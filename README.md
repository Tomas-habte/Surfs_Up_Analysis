# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to pull and summarize data to understand temperature trends before opening a surf and ice cream shop business. For this analysis, we used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy.

## Results
The summarized data for temperatures in June and December reveals three key differences:
- On average, it is slightly warmer in June (74.9 °F) than December (71.0 °F).
- The lowest temperature recorded in June was 64 °F and in December it was 56 °F.
- The highest temperature recorded in June was 85 °F and in December it was 83 °F.

## Summary 
The summarized data shows that there is no significant difference in average temperature as it is only 4 degrees warmer in June than December. The highest temperature recorded in both months is also very close. However, there is a signficant difference in the lowest temperature recorded is both months. The standard deviation is also higher in December compared to June so the temperature will vary more. While this may be concerning, all in all, the summary statistics show that it is sustainable to run the surf and ice cream shop business all year-round.
